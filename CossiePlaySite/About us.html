  CossiePlay is a family-run business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012. We create outstanding custom-made costumes. Cosplayers can order any kind of costume - from simple Spiderman or elf costumes right up to costumes including advanced features like armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and working force fields. Depending on the difficulty, costumes take between 1 and 50 weeks and cost between $10 and $10,000.Here are some more details for you:<br><ul> 
		We buy and sell second-hand costumes (a price list is available) as well.<br></ul>
	<ul> On the first Saturday of every month we hold a “CossiePlay Party” at the town hall. Entry is $15 for adults, $10 for ages 6-17 and kids under 6 are free. <br></ul>
	<ul>Each entry includes one non-alcoholic drink and a glow stick. Parties start at 6pm and run until 11pm. There is always a live DJ at the party (who takes requests) and dancing is common (but not required)<br></ul>
	<ul>First-time party-goers get a 50% discount on entry<br></ul>
	<ul>If you get a costume custom made, your next party entry is free if you wear that costume.<br></ul>
	<ul>Wear your costume in to KFC on Stanton street and you can get a free drink with a 21-piece bucket. Tell them you’ve been to CossiePlay!<br></ul><br>
	<h1>What is CosPlay?</h1>
Cosplay, a portmanteau of the words costume play, is a performance art in which participants called cosplayers wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character. Cosplayers often interact to create a subculture and a broader use of the term "cosplay" applies to any costumed role-playing in venues apart from the stage. Any entity that lends itself to dramatic interpretation may be taken up as a subject and it is not unusual to see genders switched. Favorite sources include manga and anime, comic books and cartoons, video games, and live-action films and television series.
